    "MEDV shows a moderate negative correlation with CRIM (Per capita crime rate by town), implying that areas with higher crime rates tend to have lower median home values.",
    "There is a moderate negative correlation between MEDV and AGE (Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940), indicating that older homes tend to have lower median values.",
    "The feature RAD (Index of accessibility to radial highways) has a moderate negative correlation with MEDV, suggesting that homes farther away from radial highways tend to have lower median values.",
    "INDUS (Proportion of non-retail business acres per town) and NOX (Nitric oxides concentration) both have moderate negative correlations with MEDV, indicating that higher levels of these features are associated with lower median home values.",
    "The correlation between MEDV and other features like ZN (Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.), CHAS (Charles River dummy variable), TAX (Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000), PTRATIO (Pupil-teacher ratio by town), and B (Proportion of blacks by town) is relatively weaker.",
    "There are strong positive correlations among some features like RM and LSTAT, and strong negative correlations among others like CRIM and AGE, suggesting potential multicollinearity issues."
